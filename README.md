# reopt examples

This repository was designed to run inside the following docker container: https://hub.docker.com/r/galoisbinaryanalysis/reopt

The `examples` directory contains subdirectories with example programs `reopt`
and `reopt-vcg` can be run on.

Each directory has a `Makefile` such that `make` will build the respective binary
and run the entire `reopt` toolchain on it.
